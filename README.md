# Anomaly-Detection-Toolkit Repository
This repository includes tools and algorithms for anomaly detection in sensor data before it is uploaded to the blockchain. Below is a detailed description of the files:
- supplychain.ipynb
Source code for the semantic clustering algorithm applied to the Dataco dataset. This algorithm groups data points based on semantic similarities to improve traceability.
- cv.ipynb
Simulation experiments for multi-party cross-validation algorithms. This file demonstrates the validation process to ensure the robustness of the anomaly detection models.
- abDetectBatch_sofia.ipynb
Source code for batch anomaly detection on the Sofia dataset. This script identifies outliers in the dataset for pre-blockchain data verification.
- AirQualBatch.ipynb
Source code for batch anomaly detection on the AirQualityMonitor dataset. This script detects anomalies in air quality sensor data.
- dataTojson.ipynb
Source code for converting public datasets into JSON files. This script prepares the data for use in the traceability system.
- JSON Files
Sample JSON files used for testing the system APIs with Postman. These files contain structured data for API testing and integration.
